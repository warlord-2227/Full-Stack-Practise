#Why we need different languages 
different people write different codes and that code converts to binary 
# interpretor - js,python are using this. This interpretors are converting whole line by lines and runs 
# compiler - First need to save into one object and won't create compiled files in program if errors are there . c++, java
# core - runs a process 
# single threaded languages - js only runs on single thread and load can't be shared between threads and bad choice for scalables
# multi thread languages - c++/Java
